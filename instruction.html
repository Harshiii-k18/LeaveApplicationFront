Also, such cases are to be put up to the FA & CAO for his concurrence before these are put up to the General Manager for sanction. These powers are to be exercised personally by the General Managers and are not to be delegated further.

Presidents decision 2.Divisional Rail Managers (DRMs)/Chief Workshop Engineers (CWEs) are empowered to relax the provisions of Rule 554-R.I, 1985 edition, in individual cases, meriting sanction of Hospital leave beyond a period of 120 days on leave salary equal to leave salary while on leave on average pay, subject to such cases being reviewed by the Medical Superintendents and concurred in by Senior Divisional Accounts Officer/Associate Accounts Officer.

Furthers as already stipulated in Boards letter of even number dated 14-1-93, a list of all such cases should be put up to the General Managers half-yearly for their post facto approval. Papers to General Managers should be routed though the controlling SAG officers. It may also be ensured that payment against Hospital Leave whenever due is made regularly and not allowed to pend.

President decision 4.It has been decided that such cases of railway servants injured on duty during the intervening period from 1985 to 14-1-93 and where Hospital Leave was not granted beyond 120 days on full average pay may be reviewed by the Railways, and accordingly leave should be regularised, by the General Manager as Hospital Leave beyond 120 days on full average pay in terms of extant orders on the merit of each case for the intervening period from 1985 to 14-1-93.
